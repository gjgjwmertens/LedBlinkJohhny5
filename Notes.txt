Created project 30-09-2016
Dir: pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/NodeJS_Projects/LedBlinkJohnny5
Created a git repo
	- https://github.com/gjgjwmertens/LedBlinkJohhny5
	- TODO: still need to connect the project to the repo
      - Also see D:\Graphical Design\Lynda\WebDesign\WebProjectWorkflows\notes.txt
      - make sure you are in the root folder of the project
      - create a .gitignore file with the files and folders you do not want into git
      - git init
      - git add .
      - git status
      - git commit -m "comment"
      - git config --global user.name "gjgjwmertens"
      - git config --global user.email "G.J.G.J.W.Mertens@uva.nl"
      - git log
      - git branch
      - git remote add origin https://github.com/gjgjwmertens/LedBlinkJohhny5
      - git push -u origin master
      - since there is already something in the repo you have to do a pull first
         - git pull origin master (merge)

- npm init (see package.json)
- npm install johnny-five --save

In order for Johnny5 to connect to the Arduino board you need to upload the StandardFirmata firmware.
You use the Arduino IDE to do this. You can either hook the uno up to the laptop or install arduino IDE on the raspberry.
I chose the later
	- In the Arduino IDE File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
		- The so called firmware is just an other sketch uploaded into the ardruino
	- Upload
