Created project 30-09-2016
Dir: pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/NodeJS_Projects/LedBlinkJohnny5
Created a git repo
	- https://github.com/gjgjwmertens/LedBlinkJohhny5
      - Also see D:\Graphical Design\Lynda\WebDesign\WebProjectWorkflows\notes.txt
		- Y:\Projects\Electronica\RaspBerryPi\Projects\BlinkLedJohnny5\github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf
      - make sure you are in the root folder of the project
      - create a .gitignore file with the files and folders you do not want into git
      - git init
      - git add .
      - git status
      - git commit -m "comment"
      - git config --global user.name "gjgjwmertens"
      - git config --global user.email "G.J.G.J.W.Mertens@uva.nl"
      - git log
      - git branch
      - git remote add origin https://github.com/gjgjwmertens/LedBlinkJohhny5
      - git push -u origin master
      - since there is already something in the repo you have to do a pull first
         - git pull origin master (merge)
      - git pull origin master (get latest version, not the correct way)
	  - get fetch origin master (get the latest changes)

- npm init (see package.json)
- npm install johnny-five --save

In order for Johnny5 to connect to the Arduino board you need to upload the StandardFirmata firmware.
You use the Arduino IDE to do this. You can either hook the uno up to the laptop or install arduino IDE on the raspberry.
I chose the later
	- In the Arduino IDE File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
		- The so called firmware is just an other sketch uploaded into the ardruino
	- Upload

Making the editing process easier I use PhPStorm as an IDE.
Created a new project from existing code and configure the rpi (20.0.0.112) as host.
You can also start a SSH session from the tools menu.

To make web server development easier I started using Express
   - npm install express --save
   - created exp_app.js as a starting point
      - node exp_app.js
      - http://20.0.0.112:3000
