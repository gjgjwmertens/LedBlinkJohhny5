Created project 30-09-2016
Dir: pi@raspberrypi:~/Documents/NodeJS_Projects/LedBlinkJohnny5
Created a git repo
	- https://github.com/gjgjwmertens/LedBlinkJohhny5
	- TODO: still need to connect the project to the repo

- npm init (see package.json)
- npm install johnny-five --save

In order for Johnny5 to connect to the Arduino board you need to upload the StandardFirmata firmware.
You use the Arduino IDE to do this. You can either hook the uno up to the laptop or install arduino IDE on the raspberry.
I chose the later
	- In the Arduino IDE File > Examples > Firmata > StandardFirmata
		- The so called firmware is just an other sketch uploaded into the ardruino
	- Upload
